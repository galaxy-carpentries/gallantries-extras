* Prepare for visiting instructors
  * Make travel arrangements for them or communicate the reimbursement process
  * Make accommodation arrangements for them or maybe point out some good choices using your local knowledge
  * If you will give instructors a thank-you gift, find something that is inclusive regardless of their background (so wine/chocolate/food are bad choices). Hand written thank you card is a good choice.

* Make a reservation for a social dinner, if any.
